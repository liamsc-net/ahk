####How do i use autohotkey:

I use autohotkey to control 2 secondary keyboards, one keypad and also for scripts to be directly launched from my stream deck. I have a total of **222** individual keys that I have programmed to do really annoying tasks that are a PIA, like opening visual studio code and putting it on the right monitor, or writing out copy & paste tasks like boilerplate code. and to automatically organize files and folders.
