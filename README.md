#### How do I use AutoHotKey:

I use **AutoHotKey** to control two **secondary** keyboards, one keypad. I also code scripts to be **directly launched** from my stream deck. I have a total of **222** individual keys that I have programmed to do really **annoying tasks** that are a PIA, like opening visual studio code and putting it on the right monitor, or writing out copy & paste tasks like boilerplate code. and to automatically organize files and folders.
